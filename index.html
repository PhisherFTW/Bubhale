                <a href="https://youtu.be/LbO60oFP3bo">Video</a>
                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pistol rounds (and ecos) try to have more calm aim and focus on tapping for the head instead of spamming.</li>
                    <li>When attempting to trade a teammate try to stay within tradeable distance at all times because if you are too far away your teammate could die without you having a chance to trade.</li>
                    <li>Only pull-out utility when you are certain you cannot get peeked or have cleared all positions that pose a threat to you, and try not to throw LOS(Line of sight) utility.</li>
                    <li>Do not stick the plant if you think an enemy is going to peek you (only do this if there is no-time to plant in a different place such as less than 7 seconds left on the clock.)</li>
                    <li>When peeking, peek with full focus and like you expect and enemy to be at every angle you peek.</li>
                    <li>When throwing utility make sure you take your time to get the lineup right because if you don’t wasted utility is worse than unused utility.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>FFA Community-Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Solid flicking and quite comfortable spray but when doing large flicks crosshair does not stay alone the X axis line and either deviates up or down not flat.</li>
                    <li>Nice spraying for the head protocols.</li>
                    <li>Sprays on individuals is good with galiel but transfers are quite rough.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, B rush, very shaky aim on the enemy close causing you to overflick on the left and right side of the enemy's head, good job cleaning up the kill and getting a trade unfortunately you were not ready for the enemy on site. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice Xbox smoke but it came a little late, good job being prepared for the long aggression, unfortunate timing on the middle peek nearly got you punished but fortunately you had a teammate to back you up, when peeking onto A site the enemy position was unknown and they had the advantage in this situation. L</li>
                    <li>Tec-9 armour, huge nade damage from Long and then peeked in middle which was unfortunate. L</li>
                    <li>Tec-9 armour, smoke for long molly, unfortunate movement through the smoke got you caught in the doorway without being able to get out. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, moving up catwalk unfortunately you were too far from your teammate and the enemies managed to separate you from your teammate which allowed them to peek your teammate individually and then peek into you but you were not expecting the aggression which caught you off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>armour, I wouldn’t buy armour without an upgraded pistol, but if you play carefully and slowly there is a potential you pickup an upgraded pistol from a teammate, which happens on short, unfortunately, you already took 80 damage from an awper holding tight doors. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, misclick gave away your position but the continued walking allowed you to regain the positional advantage, unforutnate timing as you ran into uppers into the lurk smoke position there was one enemy pushed up into tunnels and caught you with utility out. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice lurk smoke on B and good clear platform unfortunately you were not fully focused on the peek which meant even though you start shooting first your crosshair placement was slightly off. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice movement onto A site but your molly cat was too deep and it allowed one enemy past it and then after killing your teammate you tried to stick the bomb plant but this left you completely open. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, easy long take, nice plant, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice B push and solid flash through tunnels, but bad LOS smoke almost got you punished by smoking door and unforutnately you were not ready for the door push and because you were running the enemy knew your exact position. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, long push you noticed the long push but put yourself at a bad angle which got you punished by the pushing CT’s. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice smoke Xbox but you almost got punished for bad movement on Xbox by accidentally falling off xbox. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice xbox smoke, when rotating to uppers late you were not expecting the uppers push which caught you off-guard but good reaction to fall back to a safer angle and then catch him when he regressed 3-12KD 9-6Score. W</li>
                    <li>CT pistol armour, When engaging in a pistol duel you were spamming quite quickly and were aiming for bodyshots. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, nice long rotate but they were expecting you and there was nothing you could do. L</li>
                    <li>Five-seven armour, nice peek from stairs but unfortunately you didn’t lineup the kill properly and this allowed him to spray you down with the mac-10. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice rotate from B early to cover long which was left open, although the reposition in CT was dangerous as it left you open to middle aggression and constantly switching between middle and long and you eventually got shot in the back from middle, unlucky. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job realizing you didn’t “need” headarmour because of the weapons you are going against lets see if it pays off, good job playing B the way I recommend it although just holding the angle usually leads to people falling asleep so I recommend jiggleing the angle every few seconds, bad smoke tunnels allows for the enemy to play aggressive and use it as a 1-way which got you caught off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>P250 no armour, really nice trade on your teammate lowers tapping calmly for the head, allowing you to get an AK upgrade, unforutnately you were sitting in an angle they cleared and because you had no armour they killed you in 3 bodyshots with a lot of aim-punch. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Interesting position car, and good reaction to their lurk smoke dropping the molly behind the smoke to stop any aggression immediately and good awareness about the smoke potential but I recommend trying to deal with them and not waiting for further aggression, good patience on B waiting for the take, and this allowed you to secure a quick kill and nice play around scaffolding to secure a second. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, wasted molly and missed smoke, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good recognition of the lurk smoke but the failed molly and wasted smoke were not a good idea, unforutnate fight against the enemy pushing and doing a mid to B split. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a little bit of panic utility dumping on B and you should have repositioned after dropping your utility, good callouts but unfortunate wiff on the enemy jumping out window. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice reposition elevator to catch the enemy running up cat off-guard and nice attempt at aggression to catch the enemy on site off-guard which you did but a small wiff cost you that kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, no action. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the positions you played? <br> I haven’t played B in while and I usually play long to I just wanted to play B because the aim duels are a little closer and I feel kind of comfortable.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br> I felt like my crosshair was sometimes on the enemy but sometimes I felt like I was just swinging my crosshair around nervously.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during that game? <br> No, nothing felt like I had ever done it before, I would sometimes flick off of the enemy and my sprays felt completely off. </li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br> T side I felt like I was playing a lot more of a lurker / support role and I would probably say I wasn’t being confident enough or aggressive enough and sometimes when the enemy was just running up and peeking me.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel? <br> My movement felt good for the most part but there were some rounds where I had unintentional movement errors and in terms of rotations I felt a little awkward about when to rotate because teammates would fuss about it.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br> I think my utility was pretty good, especially T side, and I think I was using utility alright but sometimes I would throw utility but I wouldn’t use it or get teammates to use it.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving the correct information? <br> There were 2 comms that stick out and I just forgot the callout and there was another comm that I called and it was completely wrong.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing could you immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br> Probably positioning and utility usage.</li>
                </ul>

                <a href="https://youtu.be/okMe4H71o6k">Video</a>
                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try to keep your positional advantage for as long as you possibly can, as a few times during that game you ran when you didn’t need to and let the enemy know your position. </li>
                    <li>Don’t be afraid to call for a save whenever the enemies numbers are double your teams, carrying weapons over to the next round can be much more valuable than potentially losing them in a disadvantaged retake.</li>
                    <li>When you have a timing based protocol like van jump spotting or jiggle peeking angles, you need to make sure you are focused on doing them at a regular interval as if you delay them the enemy can easily get into a position that can catch you off-guard or your teammate.</li>
                    <li>Whenever you are on T pistol round you want to close the distance as much as you possibly can as the glock is stronger than the USP at close range but not at long range.</li>
                    <li>When you get on-site your objective should be as follow: Completely Clear site → Plant bomb(if you have it) → get into an advanced position. but you were skipping the first part and this nearly got you punished a few times.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>FFA Community-Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Play on a North American server  with less than 70 ping, its quite hard to look at engagements analytically if you are sevely lagging</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Mirage</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, great comms starting the game, nice positioning B with the headshot angle, and nice attempt at the A retake unfortunately it was a 1v5 situation. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, Nice position on B belcony and solid initial kill on the enemy running out belcony unfortunately you panicked after the kill and couldn’t pickup the mac10 and look at another enemy. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice positioning on B with the jiggle peeking, on the window angle site, good rotate to Window position although you accidentally gave away your position when you ran jungle, good patience to sit in window just chilling. W</li>
                    <li>Ak buy, good molly drop apps and solid position Van and nice instant triple spray down and then the quad for the late enemy, Great quad. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, really good jump spotting apps although you could be doing it more safely as it stands if someone peeks with an AWP / AK and are holding for your jump spot they could technically get you, good rotate to A unfortunately that meant you left B open which is where the enemies came from, good retake and solid play smoking the bomb and defusing and then getting the kill after the defuse. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, unfortunately you got left in a 2v4 situation and you were actually going for the retake but whenever it is a 2v4 situation you should immediately save, good job after your teammate died you went to save, good save. L</li>
                    <li>AK buy, unfortunately you were left in a 1v4 situation and had to immediately save, I like your attempted save position ontop of shelf but unforutanely you were overly exposed. L</li>
                    <li>P250 buy, really good job closing the distance and getting the enemy within the p250 optimal range and securing the kill and getting an AK, good patience and timing to peek the enemy CT and then really solid positioning and patience to wait for the enemy firebox to peek you, nearly burnt ;) but its okay, good clutch. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, good job communicating you think you should save in a 2v4 situation, unfortunately, your teammate was stuck in a hard position, although your save position wasn’t optimal catwalk, good job staying alive a lot of these rounds it feels like you have no say in as it is very quickly an “unwinnable” situation, maybe try faster rotates in order to have a little more impact. L</li>
                    <li>AK buy, good patience on the retake and not peeking raw, fortunately, you didn’t have to do anything, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, Nice rotation but it was a little slow, and this forced you to use your smoke to disperse the enemy's molly. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, again closing the distance and getting information which is fantastic, nice job flanking and attempting to catch saving enemies off-guard, and nice kill on the low enemy getting a free AK. L</li>
                    <li>AK buy, a bit of a delayed jump spot caused the enemy to have an advanced position which caught you off-guard fortunately you dropped the molly in time, and did good damage but unfortunately you didn’t trust your teammate's call which got you killed by the enemy who got van. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice quick rotate into an advanced position jungle and nearly doing a ton of damage to the enemy crossing site unfortunately you were not fully focused on the enemy crossing and they managed to do good damage which caused you to fall back and then the enemy connector went agro jungle which also mostly caught you off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>P250 buy, nice attempt at flanking and good push through B but unfortunately, the enemy was looking for you and managed to do a right counter-strafe and get you. L</li>
                    <li>T side Pistol armour, nice positioning palace and good pathing although as you exited palace you did the wrong protocols which basically put you in front of 3 CT which is what killed you if you had just jumped from palace into A site this would have been drastically different. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, good positioning in apps moving through methodically, unfortunately after you got out of cat your clearing dropped off as you ran straight to market ignoring the enemy already peeking you catwalk and empty pillar and then jumped through window straight into another enemy. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, good job spotting the smoke that wasn’t going to get thrown and filling in with your smoke, nice job asking for someone to watch your CT while you plant but when you knew the position of the last enemy you were still clearing ramp and other positions while the enemy was connector. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, first gun v gun round, nice support utility smoking market window and flashing over, again not clearing your angles properly and nearly dying to jail while going for the plant, teammate hits an insane flank getting a triple. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job properly clearing palace after coming late, nice peek into jungle and solid spraying for the head, nice peek into stairs to get a 2nd kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice job following my palace protocols, be weary when rotating late and be ready to meet a flank so always keep your weapon out, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice lamp flash although it could be seen as a small waste because there was no one to take advantage of the flash x2 but I know the second one a teammate asked you for it, good aggression, unfortunately, the enemy caught you off-guard catwalk but I think your teammate called the wrong position. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice A smoke and good aggression unfortunately your entry pathing wasn’t the best with the triple smoke and you got flashed which was unfortunate. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting middle flash, nice top connector smoke with the grenade bind, a little gap but good job getting up catwalk, unfoundedly your teammate wasn’t behind you backing you up and this led to you taking a fight against a CT pushing catwak. L</li>
                    <li>p250, nice patience to properly lineup the kill on the awper window so nice kill unfortunately an enemy pushed top middle and this allowed him to catch you off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice jungle smoke and lamp flashes so very nice take, good job killing the enemy peeking CT, and nice peek onto the enemy peeking top stairs. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice utility onto A site, unfortunately it was an A stack and this forced you to rotate to B but you were not ready for the underpass aggression. L</li>
                    <li>P250, attempted to entry onto B site through a molly and got tagged by 1 bullet slowing you down and unfortunately you brunt to a crisp. L</li>
                    <li>AK buy, nice CT smoke and attempted trade ramp but unfortunately you were not able to trade. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice kill on the enemy peeking window, bad flash onto B blinding your teammates a little bit, nice kill on the enemy flanking apps. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life? <br>I was comfortable </li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the positions you played? <br>I was very happy and comfortable. </li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>It felt good, maybe not spectacular but I didn’t feel like I needed to make any big wide adjustments.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during that game? <br>My flick were on the enemy and my spray felt really good.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>My crosshair was sometimes on the enemy and there were some rounds I got caught off-guard and other than that I would say my T side were super solid, and on CT side I would say they were pretty solid and I had quite a few rounds I would say went pretty well.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel? <br>I felt like my rotations felt pretty crisp that game and for my movement I felt like it wasn’t bad and making sure I was going to positions that were not full.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel?<br>Actually really good and I would say there were times I would “want” to throw LOS utility and instead I resisted and I felt like the smokes I did throw landed pretty good. </li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving the correct information?<br>I would say there were some rounds were I had to think where the enemy was, and sometimes clouded up the comms.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing could you immediately improve on for the next game you play?<br>I had a couple movement mistake that I wasn’t punished for, and being a little bit more conscious about it.</li>

                <a href="https://youtu.be/gjHWChNWMqE">Video</a>
                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Overaggressions on light buy rounds, it seems like in the majority of your light buys with tec-9 you just try to rush somewhere oftentimes putting yourself in severely disadvantageous fights.</li>
                    <li>Whenever taking a peek, do it with full focus instead of on autopilot as your reaction time is noticeably worse when you take a fight without full focus.</li>
                    <li>When planting the bomb make sure you are not exposed to any enemies peeking</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Mirage</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, nice positioning B site holding the window peek, nice attempt at the spam through the smoke, good patience on the retake and not overpeeking, no action, solid defuse. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, I like the use of the headshot angle on B ontop of the boxes looking into B apps, solid positioning for the cat peek but you peeked very wide and a little carelessly good job getting one kill and getting away even after peeking 3 at once, good smoke onto site to give you some space to move around and nice positioning near smoke, solid second peek onto the last enemy who didn’t know where you were to get the double. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, nice positioning on B and once you realized it would be an A good positioning jungle to hold for any flank, after knowing where the last good nice offer to flash palace for a teammate, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, Good jump spotting towards apps and doing it a but more carefully, nice double flash towards middle to allow your teammate to peek middle, good job calling the save in a 1v3 situation when they got the bomb down, nice save position towards B apps, good use of sound to kill the one enemy hunting you. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, interesting choice to drop for teammates instead of doing a bad buy with teammates I would have recommended you drop them pistols as 2 out of 5 of you had a very bad smg buy, which got them killed immediately a teammate got a very nice double kill on them coming out ramp unforuatnely an enemy peeked you top ticket nicely which gave him the advantage. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, nice attempt at closing the distance between you and the enemies on your first engagement and nice info pushing through apps and then lowers to connector, if the awp had missed his first shot there was a good chance you get that kill. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice apps jump spotted with the molly pin pulled out, again left in a 1v3 situation you make the right call to save but choosing the exact same position that you save last time could give them a very good idea of your save position, fortunately they don’t all hunt. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice mid flash and solid catwalk smoke for a 1-way top middle unfortunately your teammate had already called middle cleared so it was a little bit of a waste, enemies flank from B and kill you catwalk while the main attack is on A which is just unlucky. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice utility and nice attempt at using your catwalk smoke again but your flash onto catwalk was a bad idea and when you went into the smoke you should have been looking at the gap in your smoke instead of straight into the smoke so you can shoot back at any enemies looking at you, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice B protocols with the molly pin pulled and the jump spotting apps, good quick rotate unfortunately your teammates died quickly leaving you in a 2v4 situation luckily your teammate cleaned up very nicely and you got a solid kill on the enemy peeking from firebox where you mollied. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice reposition from van to top wooden box B for the apps headshot, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, good reaction to drop the molly unfortunately it bounced off the wall and landed through the window which was unfortunate, but very very nice triple spraydown from van, solid reactions and overall round. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, no action. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, nice patience to wait for your teammate to be in the optimal position, and good attempt at walking around the corner while spraying unfortunately you didn’t expect him to peek so wide so it caught you off-guard and your reaction to his peek was a little slow but luckily you waited earlier so your teammate was in the perfect position to trade. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, no action. W</li>
                    <li>T-side pistol armour, nice movement out onto B solid peeks but your movement when on site was dangerous a lot of unfortunate engagements. L</li>
                    <li>p250, nice kill on the enemy jumping winodw with a triple bodyshot. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice utility on A solid pathing that I talked about before good kill on the enemy default and good clearing of site, unfortunately you got spammed through the smoke CT. L</li>
                    <li>P250 buy, nice window smoke, nice connector flash, bad peek into connector from catwalk with p250 as you are peeking significantly outside the optimal range of the p250 basically making that fight impossible. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid peeks into middle, unforuantley your teammates died from the enemies connector and then when you went for the connector peek you threw a bad flash cat when you knew his position. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, dangerous psoitiong behind top middle smoke as that is a very common spam for the connector player and then your peek just left of that smoke left you open to connector which was unfortunate because both the enemy who pushed into middle and the connector player peeked and shot at you at the same time. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, your teammate somehow got a sick triple entry, unforuantley after you got onto site you immediately planted instead of waiting for the site to be cleared and this led to you being peeked from empty pillar by an enemy. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice window smoke, nice movement into B apps and solid clearing of B and making sure the porch guy was dead, unlucky after plant positions, nice to see you adding people to your friends list. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid after plant positioning CT. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice peek onto site after your teammate called the position and you caught him completely off-gaurd. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life? <br>I was comfortable and I don’t think anything can be changed right now. </li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the positions you played? <br>I was comfortable, and there was 1 round when I messed up a molly but overall I was pretty comfortable there.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>If I was holding, I felt like they were walking into my crosshair but when I was peeking on CT side I sometimes had to do larger adjustments, it overall felt okay.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during that game? <br>I feel like my flicks felt pretty comfortable and I don’t feel like there were times where I was flicking off the enemy and I feel like my spray control felt pretty comfortable too.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I didn’t really have to deal with too many awp that game, so other than that I was just kind of standardly peeking the enemies, as for executing I felt like my counter-strafing was done correctly and I don’t believe I made too many mistakes, on T side I didn’t really get that much action but I felt like I was getting carried a bit.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel? <br>I don't recall any bad rotational movement, I might have been a bit stingy with my B rotations, I felt like my rotations were appropriate.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel?<br>I would say my utility usage felt pretty good, and executions, and I tried to use a 1-way smoke catwalk a few times which almost got me punished, and I got some solid flash assists and overall I was quite happy with my utility usage, and I would just like to clean up my utility.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving the correct information?<br>I would say I gave pretty good comms, but its hard for me to tell because during that game I wasn’t getting a ton of action but I felt confident that I wasn’t clouding the comms and making extra noise but overall I feel like my comms were pretty good.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing could you immediately improve on for the next game you play?<br>I would take my time making sure I used my utility properly so I wouldn’t get punished. </li>

                <h3>Lesson video</h3>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/Ppbte9m-84Q">Video</a>
                <h3>Focus Areas:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Make sure to aim for headshots on pistol round which is the most crucial rounds during the game to get headshots.</li>
                    <li>Do not walk into danger angles as it puts you at a huge disadvantage in the fight as it makes it extremely easy for the enemy to react to you pushing.</li>
                    <li>Try your best not to die early as you are trying to have as much impact on the round and generally you can have more impact later on in the round by effectively using utility / calling and positioning yourself to get kills.</li>
                    <li>Work on continued theory crafting your Mirage B protocols as a few times during this game you got caught off-guard and tried to use utility and died while having it out.</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Mirage</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, contact B nice flick and kill on the enemy on-site, and good idea to peek the enemies off side on catwalk unfournatley your crosshair placement was low and this lead to bodyshots which couldn’t finish him off. L</li>
                    <li>p250, walk peek into lowers got you punished by an enemy sitting bench early round. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, really nice instructions to teammates to drop you flashes on the door for lamp flashes, this allowed you to throw 4 incredibly useful flashes to your teammates getting onto site, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting choice to rebuy your armour even though you had armour from last round, again nice lamp flashes, unfournatly the enemy used a 1-way on ticketbooth which you couldn’t react to before they killed you. L</li>
                    <li>P250 armour, paying B apps early round, unfournate nade damage, but good movement to get from middle to apps without making noise, unfourante engagement on the enemy belcony. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good idea to go help your teammates take mid control unfortunate the enemies counter mollied top mid boxes and this led to you being stuck out in the open. L</li>
                    <li>P250 buy, good idea to flash into lowers, unlucky on the first attempt which missed but good job sticking to your instincts and flashing again, again an unfortunate peek out lowers as you were not fully focused on someone potentially holding lowers from window. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice attempt at using utility to get out palace but you should have been more patient the palace player cannot entry onto A before the ramp players throw their utility, unfortunately, the engagement didn’t go your way as the awp had the advantage in that fight. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid movement out into the middle, unfortunatley you were not looking for the connector lowers peek play which has been used a few times this game and once against you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good calls good movement up catwalk and nice idea to get the late player to plant the bomb so you can get more agressive and get more control, allowing you to secure 2 kills. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice flashes ramp, nice trading out ramp on the enemy catwalk and then a good final play to jump triple and peek CT. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job listening to your teammate when he told you to fall back you played safe and smart, nice getting the bomb down. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid CT smoke and ramp flash, unfortunately, your teammates middle dropped the bomb and temporarily the enemies had control, solid kill on the first enemy pushing T, good clearing of apps, and nice attempt at clearing angles onto B site unfortunately the enemy was sitting at a good off-angle. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a dangerous choice to molly into the connector as the enemy could have used it to 1-way you, unfortunately, you were caught off-guard when the enemy window dinked you and then you were pushed by the enemy catwalk. L</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, nice movement protocols on palace, unlucky peek again from palace against an awp connect. L</li>
                    <li>usp armour, nice movement protocols after missing the first shot you dropped immediately and peeked right side B and secured a kill and then you went overly aggressive on B which allowed the enemy to get into a position you couldn’t react to. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, Molly apps miss, good patience on B and readiness for enemies but they cancelled, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, nice change in position from jump spotting apps and moving into top B boxes as that would have been the perfect angle for a slow apps clear, no action. W </li>
                    <li>Famas buy, nice quick reaction to the teammate call and still be  weary of a potential enemy flank, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good idea not to over-rotate and still try to keep some presence towards holding B, unfortunatley you were left in a 2v1 situation good job killing the first one instantly but when going for the second peek was slow and a bit sloppy as your crosshair placement was slightly off as well, and then pushing through your own smoke towards the enemy didn’t work out well. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid positioning but unfortunately you thought you had enough time to drop utility and while pulling out your weapon an enemy peeked you. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, bad idea to pull out utility while running into CT this nearly killed you but after just fighting the enemy CT you were still looking towards other positions and you didn’t use your remaining utility to try to help deal with him. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, nice patience waiting for the enemy to continue moving and assisting your teammate get a kill, small movement mistake jumping through window. L</li>
                    <li>p250 nade, nice nade ramp and solid followup peek into ramp to get a kill, unfortunatley you died soon after. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a bit of panic on that B defense not really knowing your B protocols, fortunately the enemies completely overlooked your position van allowing you to get behind them and get a nice double kill although if you had some trigger discipline you might have gotten more. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice rotation towards A</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in real life? <br>Quite tired</li>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the positions you played? <br>T side was kind of uncomfortable and I wasn’t used to people playing like that felt like they were continuously putting themselves in disadvantageous positions, on CT side I felt a lot more comfortable and I felt overall our holds weren’t really scary.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>Sometimes on them.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during that game? <br>Sometimes landed on them</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>I’d say I took some peeks I probably shouldn’t have, like the palace peek and I felt like most of my gunfights were within their guns optimal range.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel? <br>I know I made some movement mistakes, but I made sure to implement things I was proud of like jumping through market window, I would say my rotations can definitely be better.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel?<br>I had some good utility and some bad utility, and I threw the lamp flashes and overall I think I could have used my utility a little bit better.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving the correct information?<br>I think my communication was kind of bad during that game and I assumed people could see 1-way smokes and was kind of quiet during that game.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing could you immediately improve on for the next game you play?<br>Communication</li>

                <h3>Focus areas:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Whenever reloading make sure you are 100% safe.</li>
                    <li>When the enemies are on a full save/light buy keep your distance as they have the advantage in close range combat.</li>
                    <li>If you think you have a flank take your time and don’t rush it and accidentally throw away your positional advantage.</li>
                    <li>Stay within the weapon you are usings’ optimal range like AWP keep distance and Famas close the distance.</li>
                    <li>Don’t do the same aggressive play multiple times in a half as at a higher level people will counter you perfectly and this could lead your team to a disadvantageous position.</li>
                </ol>

                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Vertigo</p>
                <p>Starting Side: CT</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, Solid positioning on B playing super long distance, with the usp, and solid initial kill although when spamming smokes you should expect the enemy to push through if they can hear you reloading, good reactions to get the kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice mid molly and interesting play pushing behind your molly closing the distance between you and the enemies on a low buy but unfortunately, this got you punished and gave the enemy your m4. L</li>
                    <li>Deagle armour, unfortunate movement down ladder causing you to take damage, and then overaggression out ladder when you were confronted with multiple opponents. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, nice positioning super close middle to allow your usp to actually have a chance of killing an enemy, solid dink unfortunately the enemy properly cleared your position, solid overall play. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid molly middle, nice off-angle from CT towards middle, although when sitting at an off-angle you don’t need to jiggle as it just makes your angle harder to shoot through. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, solid middle utility, good callouts but unlucky timing on changing angles. L</li>
                    <li>Famas buy, bad positioning early round but fortunately, no-one peeked you and then your second engagement was much much closer which was beneficial for the fight, but you overextended. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice aggression after the plant on A to try catch the enemy off-guard great comms, solid reaction to drop the smoke and good kill, overall really good round. W</li>
                    <li>Accidentally dropped your gun playing this round with a usp, good job picking up a teammate's weapon, but running through the smoke taking super close-range engagements with the awp wasn’t a good idea and got you immediately killed. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, solid stairs utility but overaggressive after realizing the enemy was flash which left you out in the open and without the surprise advantage. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a little miss jump scaffolding, solid crosshair placement and kill in middle by CT. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, interesting smoke top stairs? unprompted, nice utility into middle for your peek and good spray for the first kill and nice timing with teammates for the second peek middle to secure the second and a nice slow clear CT towards B for the third. W</li>
                    <li>AK buy, Solid positioning middle nice flash towards B but you caught your teammate a little bit, crouching default caused your engagement to be delayed so you lost the surprise factor and the enemy was more ready for you. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Solid aggression ramp but its becoming a little obvious, nearly caught off-guard by aggression from scaffolding as you thought it was covered, over-aggression hunting the last one on 5hp and then dying from jumping. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, missed flash stairs and then reflashed and the enemy was ready for you but fortunately that engagement went your way but way too obvious, need to expand your early round plays a bit on Vertigo.</li>
                    <li>T side pistol armour, a few movement issues coming up skinny, nice attempt at using spamming but the distance was too great so it caused the enemy to have the advantage. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel armour, nice skinny smoke, wiffed galiel spray on the enemy on site, quick B fake but in order to really sell it you need to cross the metal walkway, solid distraction, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Galiel buy, missed trade opportunity on your teammate skinny, solid clearing towards B and good job clearing behind pillar backside, nice bomb plant. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice mid take and good reaction to get that instant trade, nice A side smoke, W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job creating distance between you and the shotgun so that he doesn’t have the advantage, solid calls and positioning nice, utility towards A with the flash and smoke and molly combo giving you the advantage on the guy headshot, and then solid peek towards the enemy skinny. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Middle aggression unfortunately you were not expecting the close aggression even though they did it the previous two rounds already. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good use of the tight headshot angle up towards ramp, again solid utility usage towards A, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Good awareness for the enemy close with the shotgun, a little bit of a wiff on the enemy elevator and not expecting the enemy close to push through the CT smoke. W </li>

                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br>There were some times when I went hyper agressive and sometimes I would peek multiple angles.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during that game? <br>Some solid sprays.</li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br>My peeks felt good and I feel like I was taking solid peeks</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel? <br>Some movement mistakes and some really good moments, I feel like my rotations were kind of aggressive.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel?<br>My Utility honestly felt pretty good and honestly it felt pretty good, and only some moments that the wrong utility was dropped, and overall I think util that game was better that game.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving the correct information?<br>Yea communication was good, with correct info and correct positions.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing could you immediately improve on for the next game you play?<br>Probably being more mindful about my aggression and there were a few rounds where I was trying to force a frag.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>In retakes where the enemies = 2x your teams numbers you should automatically save as the likelihood of you winning the round is slim and the weapons and economy will have more impact in the following rounds.</li>
                    <li>When playing close to teammates do not block to the best of your ability.</li>
                    <li>Slight overaggression demonstrated on CT side taking aggressive early fights often leaving you in low hp for the remainder of the round.</li>
                    <li>Listen to your inner monologue.</li>
                    <li>When taking peeks do it in a focused manner and make sure your preaim / counter-strafing is sharp.</li>
