                <h3>Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pistol rounds (and ecos) try to have more calm aim and focus on tapping for the head instead of spamming.</li>
                    <li>When attempting to trade a teammate try to stay within tradeable distance at all times because if you are too far away your teammate could die without you having a chance to trade.</li>
                    <li>Only pull-out utility when you are certain you cannot get peeked or have cleared all positions that pose a threat to you, and try not to throw LOS(Line of sight) utility.</li>
                    <li>Do not stick the plant if you think an enemy is going to peek you (only do this if there is no-time to plant in a different place such as less than 7 seconds left on the clock.)</li>
                    <li>When peeking, peek with full focus and like you expect and enemy to be at every angle you peek.</li>
                    <li>When throwing utility make sure you take your time to get the lineup right because if you don’t wasted utility is worse than unused utility.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>FFA Community-Deathmatch Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Solid flicking and quite comfortable spray but when doing large flicks crosshair does not stay alone the X axis line and either deviates up or down not flat.</li>
                    <li>Nice spraying for the head protocols.</li>
                    <li>Sprays on individuals is good with galiel but transfers are quite rough.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Match notes</h3>
                <p>
                    How my notes are structured:
                    <br> 
                    round number. what kind of buy you had, notes on what exactly happened during the round. W/L win or loss
                </p>
                <p>Map: Dust2</p>
                <p>Starting Side: T</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pistol armour, B rush, very shaky aim on the enemy close causing you to overflick on the left and right side of the enemy's head, good job cleaning up the kill and getting a trade unfortunately you were not ready for the enemy on site. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice Xbox smoke but it came a little late, good job being prepared for the long aggression, unfortunate timing on the middle peek nearly got you punished but fortunately you had a teammate to back you up, when peeking onto A site the enemy position was unknown and they had the advantage in this situation. L</li>
                    <li>Tec-9 armour, huge nade damage from Long and then peeked in middle which was unfortunate. L</li>
                    <li>Tec-9 armour, smoke for long molly, unfortunate movement through the smoke got you caught in the doorway without being able to get out. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, moving up catwalk unfortunately you were too far from your teammate and the enemies managed to separate you from your teammate which allowed them to peek your teammate individually and then peek into you but you were not expecting the aggression which caught you off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>armour, I wouldn’t buy armour without an upgraded pistol, but if you play carefully and slowly there is a potential you pickup an upgraded pistol from a teammate, which happens on short, unfortunately, you already took 80 damage from an awper holding tight doors. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, misclick gave away your position but the continued walking allowed you to regain the positional advantage, unforutnate timing as you ran into uppers into the lurk smoke position there was one enemy pushed up into tunnels and caught you with utility out. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice lurk smoke on B and good clear platform unfortunately you were not fully focused on the peek which meant even though you start shooting first your crosshair placement was slightly off. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice movement onto A site but your molly cat was too deep and it allowed one enemy past it and then after killing your teammate you tried to stick the bomb plant but this left you completely open. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, easy long take, nice plant, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice B push and solid flash through tunnels, but bad LOS smoke almost got you punished by smoking door and unforutnately you were not ready for the door push and because you were running the enemy knew your exact position. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, long push you noticed the long push but put yourself at a bad angle which got you punished by the pushing CT’s. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice smoke Xbox but you almost got punished for bad movement on Xbox by accidentally falling off xbox. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice xbox smoke, when rotating to uppers late you were not expecting the uppers push which caught you off-guard but good reaction to fall back to a safer angle and then catch him when he regressed 3-12KD 9-6Score. W</li>
                    <li>CT pistol armour, When engaging in a pistol duel you were spamming quite quickly and were aiming for bodyshots. L</li>
                    <li>Full save, nice long rotate but they were expecting you and there was nothing you could do. L</li>
                    <li>Five-seven armour, nice peek from stairs but unfortunately you didn’t lineup the kill properly and this allowed him to spray you down with the mac-10. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Nice rotate from B early to cover long which was left open, although the reposition in CT was dangerous as it left you open to middle aggression and constantly switching between middle and long and you eventually got shot in the back from middle, unlucky. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good job realizing you didn’t “need” headarmour because of the weapons you are going against lets see if it pays off, good job playing B the way I recommend it although just holding the angle usually leads to people falling asleep so I recommend jiggleing the angle every few seconds, bad smoke tunnels allows for the enemy to play aggressive and use it as a 1-way which got you caught off-guard. L</li>
                    <li>P250 no armour, really nice trade on your teammate lowers tapping calmly for the head, allowing you to get an AK upgrade, unforutnately you were sitting in an angle they cleared and because you had no armour they killed you in 3 bodyshots with a lot of aim-punch. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, Interesting position car, and good reaction to their lurk smoke dropping the molly behind the smoke to stop any aggression immediately and good awareness about the smoke potential but I recommend trying to deal with them and not waiting for further aggression, good patience on B waiting for the take, and this allowed you to secure a quick kill and nice play around scaffolding to secure a second. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, wasted molly and missed smoke, no action. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, good recognition of the lurk smoke but the failed molly and wasted smoke were not a good idea, unforutnate fight against the enemy pushing and doing a mid to B split. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, a little bit of panic utility dumping on B and you should have repositioned after dropping your utility, good callouts but unfortunate wiff on the enemy jumping out window. L</li>
                    <li>Full buy, nice reposition elevator to catch the enemy running up cat off-guard and nice attempt at aggression to catch the enemy on site off-guard which you did but a small wiff cost you that kill. W</li>
                    <li>Full buy, no action. W</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>After-PUG review</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>How comfortable were you in the positions you played? <br> I haven’t played B in while and I usually play long to I just wanted to play B because the aim duels are a little closer and I feel kind of comfortable.</li>
                    <li>How did your preaiming and crosshair placement feel? <br> I felt like my crosshair was sometimes on the enemy but sometimes I felt like I was just swinging my crosshair around nervously.</li>
                    <li>How did your muscle memory feel during that game? <br> No, nothing felt like I had ever done it before, I would sometimes flick off of the enemy and my sprays felt completely off. </li>
                    <li>How did your peeks feel on both CT and T side? <br> T side I felt like I was playing a lot more of a lurker / support role and I would probably say I wasn’t being confident enough or aggressive enough and sometimes when the enemy was just running up and peeking me.</li>
                    <li>How did your movement and rotations feel? <br> My movement felt good for the most part but there were some rounds where I had unintentional movement errors and in terms of rotations I felt a little awkward about when to rotate because teammates would fuss about it.</li>
                    <li>How did your utility feel? <br> I think my utility was pretty good, especially T side, and I think I was using utility alright but sometimes I would throw utility but I wouldn’t use it or get teammates to use it.</li>
                    <li>How did your communication feel, did you give consistent calls throughout the entire game and were you calling the correct positions and giving the correct information? <br> There were 2 comms that stick out and I just forgot the callout and there was another comm that I called and it was completely wrong.</li>
                    <li>What is 1 thing could you immediately improve on for the next game you play? <br> Probably positioning and utility usage.</li>
                </ul>
